            <b>Quarantined Chefs</b> is a non-profit project carried out purely out of good-will for the community
            in these challenging times. There are absolutely no charges associated with the platfrom and registrations are
            totally free!<br><br>
           <div class="para-title">A little back story...</div><br>
           I was at the end of one of the grestest learning experiences I've had i.e Harvard's CS50.
           The last assignment of the course was the Final Project. The task was simple; use everything you
           learnt to create something to solve an actual problem that exists around you.   
           With the onset of the pandemic, I noticed there'd been widespread unemployment and a lot of folks have taken 
           to cooking and selling food, be it as 
           a hobby or as a source of income.
           We've since seen these a growing number of these 'quarantined chefs', be it 9 year olds 
           experimenting with desserts right up to retired professional chefs.<br><br>
           <div class="para-title">The problem:</div><br>
           Most of these 'quarantined chefs' look to promote their business through social media, which admittedly 
           has a limited reach when it comes to each individual.
           Yes, food delivery apps do exist which perform a similar objective, but from a personal observation,
           these apps usually cater to full-fledged restaurants who are able to put out food on demand as they 
           have the capital, staffand other means to do so.
           In contrast, a home-based chef who could be a home-maker too, wouldn't be able to put out food 
           on demand.
           <br><br>
         <div class="para-title">The solution:</div>  <br>
                     A platform dedicated to these 'quarantined chefs' where they could register their 
           listing (for free) which would display the menu, locality, contact details as well as dedicated social 
           media buttons so that you could directly get in touch through WhatsApp, Instagram or call to 
           find out about availability, delivery, new dishes, etc.<br><br>
